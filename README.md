# GroceryOps-Order-Delivery-Performance-Dashboard
An operational analytics dashboard built using Looker Studio to analyze order volume, delivery performance, and operational bottlenecks for a fast-paced grocery delivery service.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This dashboard helps uncover insights from a month's worth of online grocery delivery operations. It is designed to support strategic decision-making by tracking order flow, identifying delivery inefficiencies, and analyzing time-based trends.

The dashboard provides an end-to-end view of:
- Order volumes across periods and weekdays
- Customer and dark store distribution
- Order status (delayed vs on-time)
- Peak vs non-peak operational efficiency
- Delay reasons and process bottlenecks
